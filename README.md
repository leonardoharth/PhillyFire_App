# Hydrant Inspector

This is an application intended for the Philadelphia Fire Department to conduct their hydrant inspections. The prioritization scores were generated using machine learning methods (to predict fire risk) and normalized summations of other scores. This project was done as part of the University of Pennsylvania MUSA 800 course.
